The [editor|director] nudges us to [computational|cosmic] [unconsciousness|consciousness]. It is the interactive media apparatus that [writers|thinkers] most know how to [play|wield], [but|and] its [predefined|plethora of] [rules|abilities] [boundary|provide for] [conceptual|contemporary] [digital expression|expression].

Even so, Derrida hesitates to [accept|understand] the editor's offer to "dematerialize the trace of writing" as such. Digital text [reveals|betrays] its own materiality, melting words to [liquid|putty]. We've now read the rumors [written|written (with chisels)] that we are in the age of sculptural text; we witness samples [dubbed|overdubbed] into remix poetry, drafts [appropriated|stashed] into the spaces between lines. The editor [blushes|reddens] in reproach of your broken [ligature|"did you mean linear?"] ways

Having left the dominance of the oral mode for the static boundary of the quiescent page ([thesis|production]), we now witness the re-enchantment of the letter ([antithesis|performance]), which threatens to [redefine|refine|reform] language as not simply [*that which cannot express*|to be passed over in silence] (Wittgenstein) but that *which cannot express*, but will nevertheless offer its helpful misdirection.

In response, to the resistance of the editor, Robinson has called upon [literacy|posthuman literacy] studies to resist the new genies of [late stage capitalism|the World Computer], as put forward by Beller. To understand [Hayles' nonconscious conscious|Beller's computational unconscious] is to [necessitate|impel] a [proxy|praxis] that can [enlist|reflect] the animated word against itself, [reference to|in reverence of] the [spirit|spiritus mundi] of the page, the epistemology of AI x corporate [control|capture].

[Digital poetics|Kinetic poetics] offers a retemporalization of the word; Hayles has accepted the invitation of the moving page to [rephrase|reformat] [from WORD AS THING|to WORD AS PROCESS]. That which static language cannot pass over (it knows no silence), moving type can happily [breath with|pause over] [skew|skip] [deform|reperform]. To resist the editor, we must learn to [play it|be played by it] lest the [speculation|dialectical reversal] unfold: [instruments of language turn us to|instrumentalized by instruments of language].

Resistive editors [compel|invite] text to [steal the spaces from|wander off] the page, 
[to express|to do its own talking] to [reimagine|return] [command|control] to [people|posthumans].
