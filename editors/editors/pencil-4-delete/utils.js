 * 
 * Extracts the text content from a contenteditable element, preserving explicit line breaks.
 *
 * It needed to be this complex for when we were doing rich text, but now the <br> and <div> stuff isn't used.
 * 
 * This function clones the provided element to avoid altering the original content. It then
 * replaces <br> tags and the beginnings of <div> tags with newline characters to preserve
 * the visual representation of line breaks. The function does not modify <span> tags, as they
 * are not typically associated with line breaks. The modified content is then returned as a
 * single string with preserved line breaks.
 *
 * @param {HTMLElement} element - The contenteditable element from which to extract text.
 * @returns {string} The text content of the element with \n characters in place of <br> and <div> tags.
