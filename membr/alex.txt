Welcome to thecaberetzara—

ALEX: (addressing the camera welcomingly, a bit out of sorts) 

the first of the two
is sorta like an alibi 
in between hands, pockets, 
wherever the roses seem to be
our dreams will be
with you
in that way it is for us to hold this world
and we can be on our hands
as our hands are in our dreams
and your dreams in our moments

when these moments turn into you,
audience, will find as back pockets
slip away from walls
over my breasts too closely together
we will keep going forward 
along each roll & every place
across both times it's been hours
alike scents scent brings forth sweetness
not yet the breath of rose trees bent nearly-apple branch
freshly released
fraglessglasseses pour shattered showshoes over snowshoe coated streets
and sweated bouquets sit
tuckedbetweenalleys
foryoutofindthem
buildings view shapes
shape dreams wear covers
there will be the show! (Greyson’s voice the show)
invisible drums rush to the back of the band
ready to await the roll
apothphosphorescent flaming sheets drift
on a newly agreed breeze exhaled between flamingo and baleen (Greyson: flamingo and baleen)
we will be original
suspended bits 
broadfreeapplexcluster wobwobthenadowsmomented

for your satisfaction
we have
taught dogs to be political
